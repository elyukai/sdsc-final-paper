# Extending the Web of Things to standardize Service Discovery in Smart Cities

## Abstract

European member states are required to make collected data from sensors available to the public while not imposing any standard on the format and scope of the provided information. This greatly decreases the discoverability and usability of that data for developers and thus the public. In this paper, we propose a new solution by creating a standard ontology for the Web of Things (WoT) standard.

To evaluate our approach, a reference implementation was built, consisting of a Thing Description Directory (TDD) and a showcasing real-life client. Our tests verified the approach as successful, while revealing potential problems and difficulties of the JSON for Linked Data (JSON-LD) format.

This paper provides the approach for handling open data in a uniform way, while being easily extendable for new use cases. It thus serves as a foundation for standardization work and further research on this topic.
