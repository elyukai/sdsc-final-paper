\subsection{Frontend}\label{sec:frontend}

We developed an Android application to utilize our \gls{api} as outlined in the introduction. The app serves as a reference implementation for connecting the backend functions shown in \autoref{sec:backend}.

The following requirements were defined by us in advance:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Filter for geographic location and a radius, minimal frequency of measurements (\gls{qos} aspects)
    \item Quick overview of the sensors in a smart city (around location)
    \item Capability to display sensors metadata and the measured values
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.1]{screen_filter}
    \caption{Filter view}
    \label{fig:screen_main}
    \Description{
        The filter view offers the option to filter by sensor type, radius around a location, and minimum frequency of measured values. The location can be specified in longitude and latitude, or selected from a map. The unit for the frequency can be selected from a dropdown menu; the unit for the radius is meters.
    }
\end{figure}

In order to meet the requirements, we developed a filter view, which is shown in \autoref{fig:screen_main}. The view offers the option to filter by sensor type, radius around a location, and minimum frequency of measured values. The location can be specified in longitude and latitude, or selected from a map.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.1]{screen_map}
    \caption{Map view showing the results}
    \label{fig:screen_results_map}
    \Description{
        The map view shows the sensors that match the filter criteria as well as a circle that represents the search area.
    }
\end{figure}

The sensors can be presented in a map or list view. This gives the user a quick overview of the surrounding sensors.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.1]{screen_detail}
    \caption{Detail view of a sensor}
    \label{fig:screen_result_details}
    \Description{
        The detail view shows the metadata of the sensor and the most recent measured value.
    }
\end{figure}

The measured values and metadata will be displayed in a detailed view. It reads the data from the \gls{td} and presents them clearly to the user.
