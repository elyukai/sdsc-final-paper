\subsection{\glsentrylong{wot}}\label{sec:wot}

One problem with \gls{sd} in the \gls{iot} space is always interoperability and compatibility between different systems. One area where these aspects are highly relevant is the internet. Web technologies must work for a wide range of devices and applications. Thus, the internet has also been used as a source of inspiration for solving such and other problems with \gls{iot} devices. This combination is commonly referred to as \gls{wot}, which we examined in a previous survey paper \autocite{Survey.Service.Discovery.in.Smart.Cities}.

The \gls{wot} offers a standard that covers the description of sensors as well as the implementation of \gls{sd}. These descriptions are kept up-to-date and are very comprehensive compared to the \gls{sd} structures examined. However, In some places the standard is not yet fully developed.

Another survey paper about the \gls{wot} by \citeauthor{Sciullo.2022.ASotWoT} \autocite{Sciullo.2022.ASotWoT} covers various aspects of the specification such as architecture, communication protocols, security, and applications. It also covers challenges and future directions of \gls{wot} research.
