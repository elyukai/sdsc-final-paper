\subsection{Context-based Service discovery}\label{sec:contextsd}

Another \gls{sd} is the context-based \gls{sd}.

\textcquote{Sukode.2015.CAFIIAS}{Context is any information that can be used to characterize the situation of an entity. An entity is a person, place, or object that is considered relevant to the interaction between a user and an application, including the user and applications themselves.}

A context like that can be defined and used to describe different services. Each area of use can be defined by a different context. How that context is built and structured depends on the usage.

If a system takes a context into account, it is called \enquote*{context-aware}. It can be used to locate the best possible service for a user.
